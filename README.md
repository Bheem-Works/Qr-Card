# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). This was a beginner-friendly project focused on practicing layout, centering, and card design using only HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This project is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

The goal of this challenge was to build a simple and responsive QR code card using only HTML and CSS. It features a centered card layout with a QR code image and descriptive text. 

This project helped me practice structuring semantic HTML, using Flexbox for layout, and applying responsive design techniques to make the component look good on different screen sizes.

##### My process
I started by setting up the basic HTML structure for the QR code card. I used semantic tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<img>` to keep it accessible and organized.

Once the structure was done, I focused on styling the layout using CSS. I used Flexbox to center the component both vertically and horizontally in the viewport. I also used custom properties for colors and spacing to keep the CSS clean and maintainable.

I followed a mobile-first approach and made sure the design looked good on smaller screens. After that, I added some padding, box-shadow, and border-radius to match the challenge design closely.

To finish, I double-checked the design against the original and made some small tweaks for spacing and alignment.
